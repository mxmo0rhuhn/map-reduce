/**
 * Implementation of a thread-safe {@link Executor} that runs an exact number of commands, that is, it expects that a
 * predefined number of commands are supplied to it. Executing that number of commands is also the termination criteria.<br />
 * <br />
 * Only supplying a command to this executor will not run them. In order to run commands, the method
 * {@link #waitForExpectedTasks()} has to be invoked.<br />
 * <br />
 * One difference between this Executor and {@link DeterministicExecutor} is that if you have one thread executing
 * commands with this executor and you're waiting in the JUnit test for all commands to be executed. What could happen,
 * however, is that the runUntilIdle method returns before the other command were even queued to be executed. This
 * executor solves exactly this problem: it makes sure all expected commands get executed.
